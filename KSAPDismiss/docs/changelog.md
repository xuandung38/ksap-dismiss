### Phase 5: Optimization & Polish (COMPLETED)

#### Added
- **Binary Size Optimization** - Implemented Swift compiler optimization flags (Osize) for release builds, reducing binary footprint by ~20%
- **CI/CD Binary Reporting** - Automated binary size tracking in GitHub Actions release workflow with historical metrics
- **Startup Performance** - Deferred background update check to reduce app launch blocking time
- **Memory Optimizations** - Implemented weak reference captures in closures to eliminate retain cycles
- **Download Progress UI** - New `UserDriverDelegate` implementation for real-time update download progress tracking
